Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU points. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight P100 GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.\"\"\",\n","        \"authors\": [\"Ashish Vaswani\", \"Noam Shazeer\", \"Niki Parmar\", \"Jakob Uszkoreit\"],\n","        \"year\": 2017,\n","        \"venue\": \"NIPS\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","        \"id\": \"paper_2\",\n","        \"title\": \"BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding\",\n","        \"abstract\": \"\"\"We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.

As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications.\"\"\",\n","        \"authors\": [\"Jacob Devlin\", \"Ming-Wei Chang\", \"Kenton Lee\", \"Kristina Toutanova\"],\n","        \"year\": 2018,\n","        \"venue\": \"NAACL\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","        \"id\": \"paper_3\",\n","        \"title\": \"GPT-3: Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\",\n","        \"abstract\": \"\"\"Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. However, this paradigm requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples, and still often fails to match human performance. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting.\"\"\",\n","        \"authors\": [\"Tom B.
