with:\n","\n","✅ **Solid Foundation**: Understanding of knowledge graphs and Neo4j basics\n","✅ **Practical Skills**: Hands-on experience with Cypher queries and graph operations\n","✅ **Visualization Tools**: Methods to explore and understand graph structures\n","✅ **Real Examples**: Academic knowledge graph that demonstrates key concepts\n","✅ **Best Practices**: Performance tips and common patterns\n","\n","**What's Next?**\n","\n","In the upcoming notebooks, you'll build upon this foundation to:\n","- Extract entities and relationships from real documents (Notebook 12.2)\n","- Construct knowledge graphs automatically (Notebook 12.3)\n","- Implement sophisticated retrieval mechanisms (Notebook 12.4)\n","- Build complete Graph RAG systems (Notebook 12.5)\n","\n","**Remember**: The key to mastering Graph RAG is understanding that knowledge is inherently connected. Traditional RAG treats information as isolated chunks, but Graph RAG recognizes and leverages the web of relationships that make knowledge meaningful.\n","\n","Keep practicing with different domains and datasets. The patterns you've learned here will serve as building blocks for increasingly sophisticated Graph RAG applications.\n","\n","Happy graphing! 🚀📊"],"metadata":{"id":"kc2ya-G9y9GU"}}]}
